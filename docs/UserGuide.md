# User Guide

## Introduction
### FitChasers User Guide
FitChasers is a desktop app for managing your fitness journey, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) 
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ss can help you 
track workouts, monitor weight progress, and achieve your fitness goals faster than traditional GUI apps.

### Interface Display (Console Width)

FitChasers' chat-style interface is optimized for clear and readable text bubbles within the console window.  
The system assumes a console width of approximately 150 characters, meaning each line of text can display up to 150 visible characters before wrapping automatically.

- This width defines how much text can appear in one line within chat bubbles.
- Messages longer than this limit are automatically wrapped to the next line.
- If your terminal window is narrower than 150 characters, the chat bubbles may wrap early or appear slightly misaligned.
- You can resize your terminal window to ensure proper alignment.

> **Notes:**  
> The `150` refers to **the number of text characters**, not pixels.  
> Each printed character (including spaces and punctuation) counts toward this width limit.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 17 or above installed.
2. Down the latest version of `FitChasers`.
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your FitChasers data.
4. Open a command terminal, cd into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the java -jar 
   FitChasers.jar command to run the application.
5. On first launch, you will be prompted to enter your name and initial weight.
6. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing `/help` and pressing Enter 
   will open the help window.

## Features
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `/create_workout n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `/create_workout n/Chest Day`.

[//]: # (* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters &#40;such as `/help`, `/exit`&#41; will be ignored.<br>)
[//]: # (  e.g. if the command specifies help 123, it will be interpreted as help.)
