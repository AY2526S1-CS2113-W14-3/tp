## Design & implementation

### Design
The Architecture Diagram given above explains the high-level design of FitChaser.
Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

#### Main components of the architecture
![Alt text](docs/diagrams/FitChaser_Architecture.jpg "Basic Architecture")
FitChasers (consisting of classes FitChasers and Managers) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
At app launch, it initializes and loads the components and data in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the appâ€™s work is done by the following six components:
1) UI: The UI of the App.
2) Logic: The command executor
3) FileHandler: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
4) ViewLog: Displays advance viewing features like summaries, or grouped data in pages
5) Managers: Records, alter and save data on relevant classes 
6) Models: Instantiatable objects that is managed by managers  
7) Commons: represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.


How the architecture components interact with each other

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command /create_workout pushup.
